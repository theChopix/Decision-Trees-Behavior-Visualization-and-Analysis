# Decision Tree Visualizaion

repository for the Bachelor Thesis commissioned by company Seznam.cz with the topic Decision Tree Visualization  
  
### Structure

The project consists of two main folders. In the "research" folder , you can find the work process that took place before creating the custom solution (captured in html documentation). In the "app" folder, you can find the actual application as the proposed solution.

### Libraries and Environment

It is essential to install the following Python libraries: 'pandas', 'plotly', 'catboost', which are used in the scripts. To run the script, the 'python3' command is used in the 'app.js' file. If you are not using this version, you can manually modify it to your preferred version in the file.

If you encounter any other issues, please contact the application developer directly at kratkja8@fel.cvut.cz.
  
### How to Run the Application Locally

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</li>
  <li>Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the main folder of web app (<b>`app`</b>), where the <b>`app.js`</b> file is located.</li>
  <li>Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the command prompt or terminal:  
  <b>`npm install`</b>  
  This command will read the package.json file in your app's directory and install all the dependencies listed there.</li>
  <li>Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Node.js app by running the following command:  
  <b>`node app.js`</b>  
  This command will execute the app.js file and start your web app.</li>
  <li>Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000.</li>
